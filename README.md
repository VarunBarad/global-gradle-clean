# Global Gradle Clean

This is a node-js script to clean all gradle projects (those which use gradle-wrapper) under a given directory.

## Installation

This module isn't made to be used under another node project/module. But it is supposed to be globally installed on your system as a stand-alone module and then used as a command-line tool whenever required.

To install this globally, run the following command from an admin shell

```shell
npm install -g global-gradle-clean
```

## Next steps

- Add file-ignore patterns
